Todo define the following functions:

Marlin.h => cli()
SREG
	Status Register defined in avr/* somewhere. 

	In Marlin.h in CRITICAL_SECTION_START _sreg stores the value of the register then cli is called then SREG is restored

	#define CRITICAL_SECTION_START  unsigned char _sreg = SREG; cli();
  	#define CRITICAL_SECTION_END    SREG = _sreg;

sei(): avr, enable interrupt

pinMode(): arduino

----millis(): arduino
----XXX: should not use RDTSC, since task can be migrated to other cores

constrain(): arduino

analogWrite(): arduino

(type:)
byte: arduino

lround: libc

F_CPU: need to define
HIGH/LOW


MACROS Defined

SUICIDE_PIN => NOT Defined
